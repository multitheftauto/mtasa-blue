Building EHS for Visual Studio 6.0

PLATFORM SDK

Platform SDK must be installed in order for any of the network code to work. Note that this may take quite a while and requires that you go to the following URL in Internet Explorer 5.0 or later.

Platform SDK
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/

Click on "Core SDK" on the left, then "Install this SDK" on the right. It will look around on your system for a while, then give you options. Only the Core SDK need be installed. This step is 167.6MB (at the time of this writing). Click the Continue button, accept the license, then click Install Now. Click ok to the warning dialogue that pops up, and the download will begin. Then you have to update the directory settings in visual studio. Microsoft provides the following directions:

PTHREADS

pthreads for windows -  make sure to get all of the .h files in the include directory and all of the .dll, .lib, and .a files from the lib directory (for completeness).


ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32/dll-latest/

PCRE

Regular expressions library

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/pcre.htm -- you want "developer files"



PME

Windows - grab the latest version. There will be a vs6 directory. Open this in visual studio. Go into project->settings, hit the C/C++ tab, Category: preprocessor, and add/change the directory in "Additional include paths" to the PCRE include file - likely c:\program files\gnuwin32\include. Build it.

EHS

HTTP server

Windows - grab the latest version. There will be a vs6 directory. Open the workspace in Visual Studio. Project->Settings, C/C++ tab, Category: Preprocessor. Additional include paths: path to pcre include directory, same as in PME step previously. Also, add the directory to the PME header files that were installed previously. You must also add the path to the pthread library installed previously. Seperate directories with semicolons. Build it.
