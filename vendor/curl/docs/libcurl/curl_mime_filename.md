# NAME

curl_mime_filename - set a mime part's remote filename

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_mime_filename(curl_mimepart *part,
                            const char *filename);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

curl_mime_filename(3) sets a mime part's remote filename. When remote
filename is set, content data is processed as a file, whatever is the part's
content source. A part's remote filename is transmitted to the server in the
associated Content-Disposition generated header.

*part* is the part's handle to assign the remote filename to.

*filename* points to the null-terminated filename string; it may be set
to NULL to remove a previously attached remote filename.

The remote filename string is copied into the part, thus the associated
storage may safely be released or reused after call. Setting a part's file
name multiple times is valid: only the value set by the last call is retained.

# EXAMPLE

~~~c

static char imagebuf[]="imagedata";

int main(void)
{
  curl_mime *mime;
  curl_mimepart *part;

  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    /* create a mime handle */
    mime = curl_mime_init(curl);

    /* add a part */
    part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

    /* send image data from memory */
    curl_mime_data(part, imagebuf, sizeof(imagebuf));

    /* set a file name to make it look like a file upload */
    curl_mime_filename(part, "image.png");

    /* set name */
    curl_mime_name(part, "data");
  }
}

# RETURN VALUE

This function returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see
libcurl-errors(3). If CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER(3) was set with curl_easy_setopt(3)
there can be an error message stored in the error buffer when non-zero is
returned.
