# NAME

CURLSHOPT_UNLOCKFUNC - mutex unlock callback

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

void unlockcb(CURL *handle, curl_lock_data data, void *clientp);

CURLSHcode curl_share_setopt(CURLSH *share, CURLSHOPT_UNLOCKFUNC, unlockcb);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Set a mutex unlock callback for the share object. There is a corresponding
CURLSHOPT_LOCKFUNC(3) callback called when the mutex is first locked.

The *unlockcb* argument must be a pointer to a function matching the
prototype shown above. The arguments to the callback are:

*handle* is the currently active easy handle in use when the share object
is released.

The *data* argument tells what kind of data libcurl wants to unlock. Make
sure that the callback uses a different lock for each kind of data.

*clientp* is the private pointer you set with CURLSHOPT_USERDATA(3).
This pointer is not used by libcurl itself.

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
extern void mutex_unlock(CURL *, curl_lock_data, void *);

int main(void)
{
  CURLSHcode sh;
  CURLSH *share = curl_share_init();
  sh = curl_share_setopt(share, CURLSHOPT_UNLOCKFUNC, mutex_unlock);
  if(sh)
    printf("Error: %s\n", curl_share_strerror(sh));
}

# %AVAILABILITY%

# RETURN VALUE

CURLSHE_OK (zero) means that the option was set properly, non-zero means an
error occurred. See libcurl-errors(3) for the full list with
descriptions.
