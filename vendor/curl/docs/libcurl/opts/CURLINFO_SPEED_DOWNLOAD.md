# NAME

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD,
                           double *speed);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Pass a pointer to a double to receive the average download speed that curl
measured for the complete download. Measured in bytes/second.

CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD_T(3) is a newer replacement that returns a more
sensible variable type.

    /* Perform the request */
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

    if(!res) {
      double speed;
      res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD, &speed);
      if(!res) {
        printf("Download speed %.0f bytes/sec\n", speed);
      }
    }
