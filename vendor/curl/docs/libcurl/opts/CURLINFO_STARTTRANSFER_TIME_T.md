# NAME

CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME_T - get the time until the first byte is received

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME_T,
                           curl_off_t *timep);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Pass a pointer to a curl_off_t to receive the time, in microseconds,
it took from the
start until the first byte is received by libcurl. This includes
CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME_T(3) and also the time the server needs to
calculate the result.

When a redirect is followed, the time from each request is added together.

See also the TIMES overview in the curl_easy_getinfo(3) man page.

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
int main(void)
{
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res;
    curl_off_t start;
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
    if(CURLE_OK == res) {
      res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME_T, &start);
      if(CURLE_OK == res) {
        printf("Time: %" CURL_FORMAT_CURL_OFF_T ".%06ld", start / 1000000,
               (long)(start % 1000000));
      }
    }
    /* always cleanup */
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
}
