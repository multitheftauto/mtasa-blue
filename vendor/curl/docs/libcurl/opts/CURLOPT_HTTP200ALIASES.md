# NAME

CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES - alternative matches for HTTP 200 OK

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES,
                          struct curl_slist *aliases);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Pass a pointer to a linked list of *aliases* to be treated as valid HTTP 200
responses. Some servers respond with a custom header response line. For
example, SHOUTcast servers respond with "ICY 200 OK". Also some old Icecast
1.3.x servers respond like that for certain user agent headers or in absence
of such. By including this string in your list of aliases, the response gets
treated as a valid HTTP header line such as "HTTP/1.0 200 OK".

The linked list should be a fully valid list of struct curl_slist structs, and
be properly filled in. Use curl_slist_append(3) to create the list and
curl_slist_free_all(3) to clean up an entire list.

The alias itself is not parsed for any version strings. The protocol is
assumed to match HTTP 1.0 when an alias match.

Using this option multiple times makes the last set list override the previous
ones. Set it to NULL to disable its use again.

libcurl does not copy the list, it needs to be kept around until after the
transfer has completed.

# DEFAULT

NULL

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
int main(void)
{
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    struct curl_slist *list;
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

    list = curl_slist_append(NULL, "ICY 200 OK");
    list = curl_slist_append(list, "WEIRDO 99 FINE");

    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES, list);
    curl_easy_perform(curl);
    curl_slist_free_all(list); /* free the list again */
  }
}

# %AVAILABILITY%

# RETURN VALUE

curl_easy_setopt(3) returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see
libcurl-errors(3).
