# NAME

CURLOPT_INTERLEAVEFUNCTION - callback for RTSP interleaved data

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

size_t interleave_callback(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb,
                           void *userdata);

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_INTERLEAVEFUNCTION,
                          interleave_callback);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype
shown above.

This callback function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has received
interleaved RTP data. This function gets called for each $ block and therefore
contains exactly one upper-layer protocol unit (e.g. one RTP packet). curl
writes the interleaved header as well as the included data for each call. The
first byte is always an ASCII dollar sign. The dollar sign is followed by a
one byte channel identifier and then a 2 byte integer length in network byte
order. See RFC 2326 Section 10.12 for more information on how RTP interleaving
behaves. If unset or set to NULL, curl uses the default write function.

Interleaved RTP poses some challenges for the client application. Since the
stream data is sharing the RTSP control connection, it is critical to service
the RTP in a timely fashion. If the RTP data is not handled quickly,
subsequent response processing may become unreasonably delayed and the
connection may close. The application may use *CURL_RTSPREQ_RECEIVE* to
service RTP data when no requests are desired. If the application makes a
request, (e.g. *CURL_RTSPREQ_PAUSE*) then the response handler processes
any pending RTP data before marking the request as finished.

The CURLOPT_INTERLEAVEDATA(3) is passed in the *userdata* argument in
the callback.

Your callback should return the number of bytes actually taken care of. If
that amount differs from the amount passed to your callback function, it
signals an error condition to the library. This causes the transfer to abort
and the libcurl function used returns *CURLE_WRITE_ERROR*.

You can also abort the transfer by returning CURL_WRITEFUNC_ERROR. (7.87.0)

# DEFAULT

NULL, the interleave data is then passed to the regular write function:
CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3).

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
struct local {
  void *custom;
};

static size_t rtp_write(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userp)
{
  struct local *l = userp;
  printf("our ptr: %p\n", l->custom);
  /* take care of the packet in 'ptr', then return... */
  return size * nmemb;
}

int main(void)
{
  struct local rtp_data;
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_INTERLEAVEFUNCTION, rtp_write);
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_INTERLEAVEDATA, &rtp_data);
  }
}

# %AVAILABILITY%

# RETURN VALUE

curl_easy_setopt(3) returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see
libcurl-errors(3).
