# `--false-start`

Use false start during the TLS handshake. False start is a mode where a TLS
client starts sending application data before verifying the server's Finished
message, thus saving a round trip when performing a full handshake.

This functionality is currently only implemented in the Secure Transport (on
iOS 7.0 or later, or macOS 10.9 or later) backend.
