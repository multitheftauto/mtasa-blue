# `--proxy-cacert`

Use the specified certificate file to verify the HTTPS proxy. The file may
contain multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM format.

This allows you to use a different trust for the proxy compared to the remote
server connected to via the proxy.

Equivalent to --cacert but used in HTTPS proxy context.
