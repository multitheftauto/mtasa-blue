# `--keepalive-cnt`

Set the maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send but get no response
before dropping the connection. This option is usually used in conjunction
with --keepalive-time.

This option is supported on Linux, *BSD/macOS, Windows \>=10.0.16299, Solaris
11.4, and recent AIX, HP-UX and more. This option has no effect if
--no-keepalive is used.

If unspecified, the option defaults to 9.
