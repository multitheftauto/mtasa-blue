# VERSION

This man page describes curl `%VERSION`. If you use a later version, chances
are this man page does not fully document it. If you use an earlier version,
this document tries to include version information about which specific
version that introduced changes.

You can always learn which the latest curl version is by running

    curl https://curl.se/info

The online version of this man page is always showing the latest incarnation:
