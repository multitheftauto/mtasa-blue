# Reporting a Vulnerability

Before disclosing a cheat or security vulnerability, please do not try and check that they work
as they could either result in you getting globally banned or infected by a virus.

Please submit your security vulnerabilities and cheats to our [private bugtracker]. Our private bugtracker requires a forum account.

Please do not submitÂ vulnerabilities and cheats publicly, on GitHub or anywhere else.
