ARTICLE 9 

CONFIDENTIALITY
      9.1 Non-use and Non-disclosure.  Each Party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose except for the purposes set forth in this Agreement.  Each Party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party, except that, subject to Section 9.2 below, a receiving Party may disclose the other Party's Confidential Information (except Source Code unless otherwise specified in writing) to those employees of the receiving Party who are required to have the information for the purposes set forth in this Agreement, and relevant consultants, provided that the receiving Party first obtains a signed confidentiality agreement with terms similar to this Agreement from the consultants, such that consultants are under a confidentiality obligation to the receiving Party.  If a receiving Party is required by law to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise constrained by this Agreement, the receiving Party will provide the disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief.  Subject to the foregoing sentence, such receiving Party may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that the receiving Party is legally compelled or is otherwise legally required to disclose; provided, however, that the receiving Party provides such reasonable assistance as the disclosing Party may request in obtaining such order or other relief.
      9.2 Maintenance of Confidentiality.  Each Party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other Party.  Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no case less than reasonable care (including, without limitation, all precautions the receiving Party employs with respect to its confidential materials).  Prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees, each Party shall ensure that such employees who have access to the other Party's Confidential Information have signed a non-disclosure agreement in content similar to the provisions of this Agreement or are otherwise legally obligated not to disclose such Confidential Information.  Each Party shall reproduce the other Party's proprietary rights notices on any photo or electronic copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.  A Party receiving Confidential Information shall promptly notify the Party disclosing such Confidential Information of any use or disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement of which the receiving Party becomes aware.
      9.3 Source Code.  For purposes of clarity, any Source Code may not be disclosed by a receiving Party to any third party, including consultants under non-disclosure agreements, without the prior written consent of the disclosing Party.
      9.4 Limitation on Copying.  Other than Awesomium Technologies's rights in the Improvements, the disclosing Party retains and owns all copyrights, rights in derivative works in the Confidential Information and the receiving Party hereby agrees not to copy the Confidential Information, in whole or in part, except as is necessary to perform its tasks under this Agreement.
      9.5 Return of Materials.  All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information that have been disclosed by either Party to the other Party, shall be and remain the property of the disclosing Party and shall be promptly returned to the disclosing Party upon the disclosing Party's written request.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, one (1) copy of any written or photographic Confidential Information provided by the other Party may be retained by the receiving Party for archival purposes only.
      9.6 Duration.  The confidentiality obligations of each receiving Party under this Agreement shall survive until such time as all Confidential Information of the other Party disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known and made generally available through no action or inaction of the receiving Party.  The obligations to hold information in confidence as required by ARTICLE 9 also shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
      9.7 Duty to Notify of Confidentiality Breach.  Either Party shall immediately provide written notice to the other Party of any breach of this ARTICLE 9, specifying the specific nature of the breach.  The breaching Party shall then have thirty (30) days to reasonably cure the breach.  Should such breach not be reasonably cured within sixty (60) days from receipt of such notice, then the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement.
      9.8 Availability of Equitable Relief.  Each Party understands and agrees that its breach or threatened breach of this Agreement will cause irreparable injury to the other Party and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy for such breach or threatened breach, and both parties hereby agree that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching Party will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance.  The Parties' rights under this Agreement are cumulative, and a Party's exercise of one right shall not waive the Party's right to assert any other legal remedy.
ARTICLE 10
