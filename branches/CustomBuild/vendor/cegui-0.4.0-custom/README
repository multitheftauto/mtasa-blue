This is Crazy Eddie's GUI System Mk-2; a free library providing windowing and
widgets for graphics APIs and engines where such functionality is not natively
available or is severely lacking. The library is written in C++, is object
orientated, and is primarily targeted at games developers who should be spending
their time creating great games, not building GUI sub-systems...

Note: In various documentation and online, the system is additionally referred
to as both CEGUI (which is the main namespace name), and cegui_mk2 (which is the
CVS module name of the Mk2 version of the system).


Documentation
=============
See also the following files:
COPYING   - Contains the license terms for using the library.
AUTHORS   - Contains a list of authors and contributors.

The main start point for system documentation is the Readme.html file (still
TODO).  API documentation built from the source by Doxygen
(http://www.doxygen.org) is available, and can be found online at
http://www.cegui.org.uk/api_reference/.  For the very latest
information and help, visit the project home page at
http://www.cegui.org.uk.


Supported Systems
=================
Crazy Eddie's GUI System Mk-2 is currently known to compile and run on the
following systems:

Various flavors of Linux using gcc.
Microsoft Windows running VC++6 (sp6), VC++7.0, or VC++7.1.
Apple Mac OS X running Xcode.

It is very possible that the system will compile and run on other systems and
compilers, though the above systems have been tested.


Requirements
============
As well as one of the above supported systems, Crazy Eddie's GUI System Mk-2
also requires the use of some third party external libraries.  These libraries
are as follows:

Freetype2 (http://www.freetype.org)
Optionally: Xerces-C++ XML parser (http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c)

Have Fun!
