                                  Changelog

Version 7.27.0 (27 Jul 2012)

Guenter Knauf (27 Jul 2012)
- Fixed compiler warning 'unused parameter'.

- Added prototypes to kill compiler warning.

- Added --with-winidn to configure.
  
  This needs another look from the configure experts. I tested that
  it works so far with MinGW64 cross-compiler; libcurl builds and
  links fine, but curl not yet ...

Daniel Stenberg (27 Jul 2012)
- [Ant Bryan brought this change]

  Update man page info on --metalink and typo.

- RELEASE-NOTES: remove mentioned of bug never in a release
  
  The --silent bug came with 7561a0fc834c435 which was never in a release.
  Pointed out by Kamil Dudka

- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 33b815e894fb
  
  4 more bugfixes, 3 more contributors

Guenter Knauf (26 Jul 2012)
- Changed Windows IDN text to 'WinIDN'.
  
  Synced the output to the same short form as we now use for
  Windows SSL (WinSSL).

  darwinssl: fixed freeze involving the multi interface
  
  Previously the curl_multi interface would freeze if darwinssl was
  enabled and at least one of the handles tried to connect to a Web site
  using HTTPS. Removed the "wouldblock" state darwinssl was using because
  I figured out a solution for our "would block but in which direction?"
  dilemma.

Guenter Knauf (25 Jul 2012)

Dan Fandrich (20 Jul 2012)
- Fixed some typos in documentation

Guenter Knauf (20 Jul 2012)
- Fixed CR issue with Win32 version on MSYS.
  
  Previous fix didnt work on Linux ...

- Fixed CR issue with Win32 version on MSYS.

- Fixed MSYS <-> Windows path convertion.
  
  Replaced the Windows real path from mount hack with a more
  reliable and simpler hack: the MSYS shell has a builtin pwd
  which understands a -W option which does convertion to Windows
  paths. Tested and confirmed that this works on all MSYS versions
  I have back to a 3 year old one.

- Follow-up fix to detect SSL libs with MinGW.
  
  1) the check for winssl needs to come before nss check
  2) the SSL checks must begin with a new if or else we will
  never find any SSL lib with MinGW.

- Tell git to not convert configure-related files.

- Trial to teach runtests.pl about WinSSL.

- Fixed warning 'uninitialized value in numeric gt'.
  
  This is a MSYS/MinGW-only warning; full warning text is:
  Use of uninitialized value in numeric gt (>) at ../../curl/tests/runtests.pl line 2227.

Daniel Stenberg (15 Jul 2012)
- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 9d11716933616
  
  Fixed 6 bugs, added 3 contributors

- multi_runsingle: added precaution against easy_conn NULL pointer
  
  In many states the easy_conn pointer is referenced and just assumed to
  be working. This is an added extra check since analyzing indicates
  there's a risk we can end up in these states with a NULL pointer there.

- getparam: fix the GetStr() macro
  
  It should return PARAM_NO_MEM if the strdup fails. Spotted by
  clang-analyzer

Guenter Knauf (15 Jul 2012)
- Tell git to not convert configure-related files.

Daniel Stenberg (13 Jul 2012)
- parse_proxy: remove dead assignment
  
  Spotted by clang-analyzer

- ftp_do_more: add missing check of return code
  
  Spotted by clang-analyzer. The return code was never checked, just
  stored.

- getinfo: use va_end and cut off Curl_ from static funcs
  
  va_end() needs to be used after va_start() and we don't normally use
  Curl_ prefixes for purely static functions.

- [Philip Craig brought this change]

  Split up Curl_getinfo
  
  This avoids false positives from clang's scan-build.

Guenter Knauf (12 Jul 2012)
- Added error checking for curl_global_init().

- Added curl_global_* functions.

- Minor fixes to MinGW makefiles.

Daniel Stenberg (12 Jul 2012)
- docs: mention CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT

Guenter Knauf (12 Jul 2012)
- Added curl_global_* functions.

Daniel Stenberg (12 Jul 2012)
- tests: verify the stricter numeric option parser
  
  Test 1409 and 1410 verifies the stricter numeric option parser
  introduced the other day in commit f2b6ebed7b.

- SWS: use of uninitialized memory fix
  
  I made "connmon" not get initialized properly before use, and I use the
  big hammer and make sure we always clear the entire struct to avoid any
  problem like this in the future.

- test48: verify that HEAD doesn't close extra
  
  Two commits ago, we fixed a bug where the connction would be closed
  prematurely after a HEAD. Now I added connection-monitor to test 48 and
  added a second HEAD and make sure that both are sent over the same
  connection.
  
  This triggered a failure before the bug fix and now works. Will help us
  avoid a future regression of this kind.

- connection-monitor: always log disconnect when enabled
  
  This makes verifying easier and makes us more sure curl closes the
  connection only at the correct point in time. Adjusted test 206 and 1008
  accordingly and updated the docs for it.

- HEAD: don't force-close after response-headers
  
  A HEAD response has no body length and gets the headers like the
  corresponding GET would so it should not get closed after the response
  based on the same rules. This mistake caused connections that did HEAD
  to get closed too often without a valid reason.

Guenter Knauf (12 Jul 2012)
- Removed trailing empty strings from awk script.

- Cleaned up version awk script.

- Added project copyright header.

- Removed libcurl.imp from Makefile.am.
  
  Updated .gitignore for NetWare created files.

- Added missing dependency to export list.

- Fixed export list path.

- Changed NetWare build to generate export list.

- Added pointer to FAQ for linkage errors.

- Small NetWare makefile tweak.

- Changed MinGW makefiles to use WINSSL now.

Daniel Stenberg (10 Jul 2012)
- test231: fix wrong -C use!

- cmdline: parse numerical options stricter
  
  1 - str2offset() no longer accepts negative numbers since offsets are by
  nature positive.
  
  2 - introduced str2unum() for the command line parser that accepts
  numericals which are not supposed to be negative, so that it will
  properly complain on apparent bad uses and mistakes.

Daniel Stenberg (9 Jul 2012)
- test 46: use different path lengths to get reliable sort order
  
  Since the order of the cookies is sorted by the length of the paths,
  having them on the same path length will make the test depend on what
  order the qsort() implementation will put them. As seen in the
  windows/msys output posted by Guenter in this posting:
  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-07/0105.html

- cookie: fixed typo in comment

- [Christian Hägele brought this change]

  https_getsock: provided for schannel backend as well
  
  The function https_getsock was only implemented properly when USE_SSLEAY
  or USE_GNUTLS is defined, but it is also necessary for USE_SCHANNEL.
  
  The problem occurs when Curl_read_plain or Curl_write_plain returns
  CURLE_AGAIN. In that case CURL_OK is returned to the multi-interface an
  the used socket is set to state CURL_POLL_REMOVE and the easy-state is
  set to CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT. This is fine, because later the socket
  should be set to CURL_POLL_IN or CURL_POLL_OUT via multi_getsock. That's
  where https_getsock is called and doesn't return any sockets.

- RELEASE-NOTES: added a URL reference to cookie docs

Guenter Knauf (8 Jul 2012)
- Removed obsolete include path to project root.

Daniel Stenberg (8 Jul 2012)

  darwinssl: don't use arc4random_buf
  
  Re-wrote Curl_darwinssl_random() to not use arc4random_buf() because the
  function is not available prior to iOS 4.3 and OS X 10.7.

- KNOWN_BUGS: #80 Curl doesn't recognize certs in DER format

- KNOWN_BUGS: #79 - any RCPT TO failure makes and error

Marc Hoersken (8 Jul 2012)
- winbuild: Aligned BUILD.WINDOWS.txt and Makefile.vc usage help

- winbuild: Make USE_WINSSL depend on USE_SSPI
  
  Since WinSSL cannot be build without SSPI being enabled,
  USE_WINSSL now defaults to the value of USE_SSPI.
  
  The makefile does now raise an error if WinSSL is enabled
  while SSPI is disabled.

- winbuild: Aligned USE_SSPI with other USE_x defines
  
  Renamed external parameter USE_SSPI = yes/no to ENABLE_SSPI = yes/no.
  Backwards compatible change: USE_SSPI can still be passed as external
  parameter with yes/no value as long as ENABLE_SSPI is not given.
  
  USE_x defines are passed around with true/false values internally,
  USE_SSPI is now aligned to this approach, but still accepts external
  values yes/no being passed, just like the other defines.

- winbuild: Clean up formatting and variable naming
  
  - Changed space usage to line up with the whole file
  - Renamed CFLAGS_SSPI/IPV6 to SSPI/IPV6_CFLAGS to be
    consistent with the other CFLAGS_x variables
  - Make use of existing CFLAGS_IPV6 (previously IPV6_CFLAGS)
    instead of appending directly to CFLAGS

  darwinssl: output cipher with text, remove SNI warning
  
  The code was printing a warning when SNI was set up successfully. Oops.
  
  Printing the cipher number in verbose mode was something only TLS/SSL
  programmers might understand, so I had it print the name of the cipher,
  just like in the OpenSSL code. That'll be at least a little bit easier
  to understand. The SecureTransport API doesn't have a method of getting
  a string from a cipher like OpenSSL does, so I had to generate the
  strings manually.

- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 5a99bce07d

- KNOWN_BUGS: NTLM with unicode works with schannel/winssl!
  
  Bug #75 updated with additional info, still remains for builds with
  other backends.

- code police: narrow source to < 80 columns

Yang Tse (5 Jul 2012)
- unicode NTLM SSPI: cleanup follow-up

- unicode NTLM SSPI: cleanup
  
  Reduce the number of #ifdef UNICODE directives used in source files.

Daniel Stenberg (5 Jul 2012)
- tests: use connection-monitor and verify results
  
  Test 1008 and 206 don't show the disconnect since it happens when SWS
  awaits a new request, but 503 does and so the verify section needs that
  string added.

- http-proxy: keep CONNECT connections alive (for NTLM)
  
  When doing CONNECT requests, libcurl must make sure the connection is
  alive as much as possible. NTLM requires it and it is generally good for
  other cases as well.
  
  NTLM over CONNECT requests has been broken since this regression I
  introduced in my CONNECT cleanup commits that started with 41b02378342,
  included since 7.25.0.
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3538625
  Reported by: Marcel Raad

- sws: support <servercmd> for CONNECT requests
  
  I moved out the servercmd parsing into a its own function called
  parse_servercmd() and made sure it gets used also when the test number
  is extracted from CONNECT requests. It turned out sws didn't do that
  previously!

- FILEFORMAT: provided a full description of connection-monitor

- lib503: enable verbose to ease debugging this

- sws: add 'connection-monitor' command support
  
  Using this, the server will output in the protocol log when the
  connection gets disconnected and thus we will verify correctly in the
  test cases that the connection doesn't get closed prematurely. This is
  important for example NTLM to work.
  
  Documentation added to FILEFORMAT, test 503 updated to use this.

Guenter Knauf (4 Jul 2012)

  DarwinSSL: allow using NTLM authentication
  
  Allow NTLM authentication when building using SecureTransport (Darwin) for SSL.
  
  This uses CommonCrypto, a cryptography library that ships with all versions of

  Before commit 2dded8fedba (dec 2010) there was logic that used
  RAND_screen() at times and now I remove the leftover #ifdef check for

  Metalink: ignore --include if --metalink is used.

  curl: Restore noprogress and isatty config values.
  
  The noprogress and isatty in Configurable are global, in a sense
  that they persist in one curl invocation. Currently once one
  download writes its response data to tty, they are set to FALSE
  and they are not restored on successive downloads.  This change
  first backups the current noprogress and isatty, and restores
  them when download does not write its data to tty.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  curl: Made --metalink option toggle Metalink functionality
  
  In this change, --metalink option no longer takes argument.  If
  it is specified, given URIs are processed as Metalink XML file.
  If given URIs are remote (e.g., http URI), curl downloads it
  first. Regardless URI is local file (e.g., file URI scheme) or
  remote, Metalink XML file is not written to local file system and
  the received data is fed into Metalink XML parser directly.  This
  means with --metalink option, filename related options like -O
  and -o are ignored.
  
  Usage examples:
  
  $ curl --metalink http://example.org/foo.metalink
  
  This will download foo.metalink and parse it and then download
  the URI described there.
  
  $ curl --metalink file://foo.metalink
  
  This will parse local file foo.metalink and then download the URI
  described there.

  curl: Refactored metalink_checksum
  
  When creating metalink_checksum from metalink_checksum_t, first
  check hex digest is valid for the given hash function.  We do
  this check in the order of digest_aliases so that first good
  match will be chosen (strongest hash function available).  As a
  result, the metalinkfile now only contains at most one
  metalink_checksum because other entries are just redundant.

  schannel: Implement new buffer size strategy
  
  Increase decrypted and encrypted cache buffers using limitted
  doubling strategy. More information on the mailinglist:
  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-06/0255.html
  
  It updates the two remaining reallocations that have already been there
  and fixes the other one to use the same "do we need to increase the
  buffer"-condition as the other two.  CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_STEP_SIZE was
  renamed to CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_FREE_SIZE since that is actually what it
  is now.  Since we don't know how much more data we are going to read
  during the handshake, CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_FREE_SIZE is used as the
  minimum free space required in the buffer for the next operation.
  CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_STEP_SIZE was used for that before, too, but since
  we don't have a step size now, the define was renamed.

  curl_schannel.h: Use BUFSIZE as the initial buffer size if available
  
  Make the Schannel implementation use libcurl's default buffer size
  for the initial received encrypted and decrypted data cache buffers.
  The implementation still needs to handle more data since more data
  might have already been received or decrypted during the handshake
  or a read operation which needs to be cached for the next read.

  schannel SSL: Implemented SSL shutdown
  
  curl_schannel.c - implemented graceful SSL shutdown.  If we fail to
  shutdown the connection gracefully, I've seen schannel try to use a
  session ID for future connects and the server aborts the connection
  during the handshake.

  schannel SSL: certificate validation on WinCE
  
  curl_schannel.c - auto certificate validation doesn't seem to work
  right on CE.  I added a method to perform the certificate validation

- Curl_rtsp_parseheader: avoid useless malloc/free
  
  Coverity actually pointed out flawed logic in the previous call to
  Curl_strntoupper() where the code used sizeof() of a pointer to pass in
  a size argument. That code still worked since it only needed to
  uppercase 4 letters. Still, the entire malloc/uppercase/free sequence
  was pointless since the code has already matched the string once in the
  condition that starts the block of code.

- curl_share_setopt: use va_end()
  
  As spotted by Coverity, va_end() was not used previously. To make it
  used I took away a bunch of return statements and made them into
  assignments instead.

  winbuild: Allow SSPI build with or without Schannel
  
  The changes introduced in commit 2bfa57bc32 are not enough
  to make it actually possible to use the USE_WINSSL option.
  Makefile.vc was not updated and the configuration name which is
  used in the build path did not match between both build files.
  
  This patch fixes those issues and introduces the following changes:
  
  - Replaced the -schannel name with -winssl in order to be consistent
  with the other options
  - Added ENABLE_WINSSL option to winbuild/Makefile.vc (default yes)
  - Changed winbuild/MakefileBuild.vc to set USE_WINSSL to true if
  USE_SSL is false and USE_WINSSL was not specified as a parameter
  - Separated WINSSL handling from SSPI handling to be consistent with
  the other options and their corresponding code path

- curl.1: 7.27.0 seems next release

- schannel: fix printf-style format strings

- Fix bad failf() and info() usage
  
  Calls to failf() are not supposed to provide trailing newline.
  Calls to infof() must provide trailing newline.
  
  Fixed 30 or so strings.

- schannel: fix unused parameter warnings

- schannel: fix comparisons between signed and unsigned

  urldata.h: fix cyassl/openssl/ssl.h build clash with wincrypt.h
  
  Building with CyaSSL failed compilation. Reason being that OCSP_REQUEST and

  via <winldap.h> in ldap.c.

- MakefileBuild.vc: Allow building without SSL
  
  In order to use Windows native SSL support define 'USE_WINSSL'

- configure: new option --with-winssl
  
  This option may be used to build curl/libcurl using SSL/TLS support provided
  by MS windows system libraries. Option is mutually exclusive with any other
  SSL library. Default value is --without-winssl.
  
  --with-winssl option implies --with-sspi option.
  
  Option meaningful only for Windows builds.

Guenter Knauf (13 Jun 2012)
- Changed Schannel string to SSL-Windows-native.
  
  This is more descriptive for the user who might
  not even know what schannnel is at all.

- schannel: remove version number and identify its use with 'schannel' literal
  
  Version number is removed in order to make this info consistent with
  how we do it with other MS and Linux system libraries for which we don't
  provide this info.
  
  Identifier changed from 'WinSSPI' to 'schannel' given that this is the
  actual provider of the SSL/TLS support. libcurl can still be built with
  SSPI and without SCHANNEL support.

  version: Replaced SSPI feature information with version string details
  
  Added Windows SSPI version information to the curl version string when
  SCHANNEL SSL is not enabled, as the version of the library should also
  be included when SSPI is used to generate security contexts.
  
  Removed SSPI from the feature list as the features are GSS-Negotiate,
  NTLM and SSL depending on the usage of the SSPI library.

  It is now correctly printed as the following:

  curl_sspi.c: Fallback to security function table version number
  Instead of reporting an unknown version, the interface version is used.

  schannel: Added special shutdown check for Windows 2000 Professional
  
  Windows 2000 Professional:  Schannel returns SEC_E_OK instead

  is zero and the first byte of the encrypted packet is 0x15,
  the application can safely assume that the message was a
  close_notify message and change the return value to
  SEC_I_CONTEXT_EXPIRED.
  
  Connection shutdown does not mean that there is no data to read

  Thanks to Paul Howarth for the hint about using unions for this.
  
  Important for winbuild: Separate declaration of sockaddr_u pointer.
  The pointer variable *sock cannot be declared and initialized right

- sasl: Moved cram-md5 authentication message creation from smtp.c
  
  Moved the cram-md5 message creation from smtp.c into the sasl module
  to allow for use by other modules such as pop3.

- pop3: Fixed an issue with changes introduced in commit c267c53017bc
  
  Because pop3_endofresp() is called for each line of data yet is not
  passed the line and line length, so we have to use the data pointed to
  by pp->linestart_resp which contains the whole packet, the mechanisms
  were being detected in one call yet the function would be called for
  each line of data.
  
  Using curl with verbose mode enabled would show that one line of data
  would be received in response to the AUTH command, before the AUTH
  <mechanism> command was sent to the server and then the next few lines
  of the original AUTH command would be displayed before the response from
  the AUTH <mechanism> command. This would then cause problems when
  parsing the CRAM-MD5 challenge data as extra data was contained in the
  buffer.
  
  Changed the parsing so that each line is checked for the mechanisms
  and the function returns FALSE until the whole of the AUTH response has
  been processed.

- pop3.c:Corrected typo in commit 69ba0da8272d

- pop3: Fixed the issue of having to supply the user name for all requests
  
  Previously it wasn't possible to connect to POP3 and not specify the
  user name as a CURLE_ACCESS_DENIED error would be returned. This error
  occurred because USER would be sent to the server with a blank user name
  if no mailbox user was specified as the server would reply with -ERR.
  
  This wasn't a problem prior to the 7.26.0 release but with the
  introduction of custom commands the user and/or application developer
  might want to issue a CAPA command without having to log in as a
  specific mailbox user.
  
  Additionally this fix won't send the newly introduced AUTH command if no
  user name is specified.

  when constructing the encoded user name.

- smtp.c: Re-factored smtp_auth_login_user() for use with passwords
  
  In preparation for moving to the SASL module re-factored the
  smtp_auth_login_user() function to smtp_auth_login() so that it can be
  used for both user names and passwords as sending both of these under
  the login authentication mechanism is the same.

- pop3: Introduced the continue response in pop3_endofresp()

- pop3: Changed response code from O and E to + and -
  
  The POP3 protocol doesn't really have the concept of error codes and
  uses +, +OK and -ERR in response to commands to indicate continue,
  success and error.
  
  The AUTH command is one of those commands that requires multiple pieces
  of data to be sent to the server where the server will respond with + as
  part of the handshaking. This meant changing the values before
  continuing with the next stage of adding authentication support.

- pop3: Small code tidy up following authentication work so far

- pop3: Added support for SASL based authentication mechanism detection
  
  Added support for detecting the supported SASL authentication mechanisms
  via the AUTH command. There are two ways of detecting them, either by
  using the AUTH command, that will return -ERR if not supported or by
  using the CAPA command which will return SASL and the list of mechanisms
  if supported, not include SASL if SASL authentication is not supported
  or -ERR if the CAPA command is not supported. As such it seems simpler
  to use the AUTH command and fallback to normal clear text authentication
  if the the command is not supported.
  
  Additionally updated the test cases to return -ERR when the AUTH command
  is encountered. Additional test cases will be added when support for the
  individual authentication mechanisms is added.

  Check checksum of downloaded file if checksum is available
  
  Metalink file contains several hash types of checksums, such as
  md5, sha-1, sha-256, etc. To deal with these checksums, I created
  abstraction layer based on lib/curl_md5.h and
  lib/md5.c. Basically, they are almost the same but I changed the
  code so that it is not hash type dependent. Currently,
  GNUTLS(nettle or gcrypt) and OpenSSL functions are supported.
  
  Checksum checking is done by reopening download file.  If there
  is an I/O error, the current implementation just prints error
  message and does not try next resource.
  
  In this patch, the supported hash types are: md5, sha-1 and sha-256.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  Always create directory hierarchy for Metalink.
  
  Filenames contained in Metalink file can include directory information.
  Filenames are unique in Metalink file, taking into account the directory
  information. So we need to create the directory hierarchy.
  
  Curl has --create-dirs option, but we create directory hierarchy for
  Metalink downloads regardless of the option value.
  
  This patch also put metalink int variable outside of HAVE_LIBMETALINK
  guard. This reduces the number of #ifdefs.

  To achieve this, first new structure HeaderData is defined to hold

  receives HeaderData pointer as userdata.  All header-related work
  (currently, dumping header and Content-Disposition inspection) are done
  in this callback function.  HeaderData.outs->config is used to determine
  whether each work is done.
  
  Unit tests were also updated because after this change, curl code always

- URL parse: reject numerical IPv6 addresses outside brackets
  
  Roman Mamedov spotted (in
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=670126) that curl would
  not complain when given a URL with an IPv6 numerical address without
  brackets. It would simply cut off the last ":[hex]" part and thus not
  work correctly.
  
  That's a URL using an illegal syntax and now libcurl will instead return
  a clear error code and error message detailing the error.
  
  The above mentioned bug report claims this to be a regression but
  libcurl does not guarantee functionality when given URLs that aren't
  following the URL spec (RFC3986 mostly). I consider the fact that it
  used to handle this differently a mere coincidence.

- -# progress meter: avoid superfluous updates and duplicate lines
  
  By comparing if a different "progress point" is reached or not since the
  previous update, the progress function callback for this now avoids many
  superfluous screen updates. This has the nice side-effect that it fixes
  a problem that causes a second progress meter line.
  
  The second line output happened because when we use the -# progress
  meter, we force a newline output after the transfer in the main loop in
  curl, but when libcurl calls the progress callback from
  curl_easy_cleanup() it would then output the progress display
  again. Possibly the naive newline output is wrong but this optimization
  was suitable anyway...

- PolarSSL: correct return code for CRL matches
  
  When a server certificate matches one in the given CRL file, the code
  now returns CURLE_SSL_CACERT as test case 313 expects and verifies.

  SSH: public key can now be an empty string

  OpenSSL: Made cert hostname check conform to RFC 6125
  
  This change replaces RFC 2818 based hostname check in OpenSSL build with
  RFC 6125 [1] based one.
  
  The hostname check in RFC 2818 is ambiguous and each project implements
  it in the their own way and they are slightly different. I check curl,
  gnutls, Firefox and Chrome and they are all different.
  
  I don't think there is a bug in current implementation of hostname
  check. But it is not as strict as the modern browsers do. Currently,
  curl allows multiple wildcard character '*' and it matches '.'. (as
  described in the comment in ssluse.c).
  
  Firefox implementation is also based on RFC 2818 but it only allows at
  most one wildcard character and it must be in the left-most label in the
  pattern and the wildcard must not be followed by any character in the
  label.[2] Chromium implementation is based on RFC 6125 as my patch does.
  Firefox and Chromium both require wildcard in the left-most label in the
  presented identifier.
  
  This patch is more strict than the current implementation, so there may
  be some cases where old curl works but new one does not. But at the same
  time I think it is good practice to follow the modern browsers do and
  follow the newer RFC.

- HTTP: reset expected DL/UL sizes on redirects
  
  With FOLLOWLOCATION enabled. When a 3xx page is downloaded and the
  download size was known (like with a Content-Length header), but the
  subsequent URL (transfered after the 3xx page) was chunked encoded, then
  the previous "known download size" would linger and cause the progress
  meter to get incorrect information, ie the former value would remain
  being sent in. This could easily result in downloads that were WAY
  larger than "expected" and would cause >100% outputs with the curl
  command line tool.
  
  Test case 599 was created and it was used to repeat the bug and then
  verify the fix.

  Generate lists and use symbols in --libcurl code output.
  
  This patch improves the output of curl's --libcurl option by

  to communicate with the mail server then the AUTH parameter will be
  included in the MAIL FROM command. This is particularly useful when the

  configure: don't modify LD_LIBRARY_PATH for cross compiles

- CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS: added
  
  Allow an appliction to set libcurl specific SSL options. The first and
  only options supported right now is CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST.
  
  It will make libcurl to disable any work-arounds the underlying SSL

- curl tool: allow glob-loops to abort again upon critical errors
  
  This prevents clobbering of non recoverable error return codes while
  retaining intended functionality of commit 65103efe

Daniel Stenberg (6 Feb 2012)
- curl tool: don't abort glob-loop due to failures
  
  We want to continue to the next URL to try even on failures returned
  from libcurl. This makes -f with ranges still get subsequent URLs even
  if occasional ones return error. This was a regression as it used to
  work and broke in the 7.23.0 release.
  
  Added test case 1328 to verify the fix.

- [Martin Storsjo brought this change]

  Explicitly link to the nettle/gcrypt libraries
  
  When support for nettle was added in 64f328c787ab, I overlooked
  the fact that AC_CHECK_LIB doesn't add the tested lib to LIBS
  if the check succeeded, if a custom success code block was present.
  (The previous version of the check had an empty block for
  successful checks, adding the lib to LIBS implicitly.)
  
  Therefore, explicitly add either nettle or gcrypt to LIBS, after
  deciding which one to use. Even if they can be linked in
  transitively, it is safer to actually link explicitly to them.
  
  This fixes building with gnutls with linkers that don't allow
  linking transitively, such as for windows.

  more resilient connection times among IP addresses
  
  When connecting to a domain with multiple IP addresses, allow different,
  decreasing connection timeout values. This should guarantee some
  connections attempts with sufficiently long timeouts, while still
  providing fallback.

  Synced and prepared for 7.24.0 release. Two security problems, one bug fix,

- gnutls: enforced use of SSLv3
  
  With advice from Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos, changed the priority string to
  add "actual priorities" and favour ARCFOUR. This makes libcurl work
  better when enforcing SSLv3 with GnuTLS. Both in the sense that the
  libmicrohttpd test is now working again but also that it mitigates a
  weakness in the older SSL/TLS protocols.

- tests: test CRLF in URLs
  
  Related to the security vulnerability: CVE-2012-0036
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124.html

- URL sanitize: reject URLs containing bad data
  
  Protocols (IMAP, POP3 and SMTP) that use the path part of a URL in a
  decoded manner now use the new Curl_urldecode() function to reject URLs
  with embedded control codes (anything that is or decodes to a byte value
  less than 32).
  
  URLs containing such codes could easily otherwise be used to do harm and
  allow users to do unintended actions with otherwise innocent tools and
  applications. Like for example using a URL like
  pop3://pop3.example.com/1%0d%0aDELE%201 when the app wants a URL to get
  a mail and instead this would delete one.
  
  This flaw is considered a security vulnerability: CVE-2012-0036
  
  Security advisory at: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124.html

- OpenSSL: don't disable security work-around
  
  OpenSSL added a work-around for a SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability
  (http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt). In 0.9.6e they added a bit
  to SSL_OP_ALL that _disables_ that work-around despite the fact that
  SSL_OP_ALL is documented to do "rather harmless" workarounds.
  
  The libcurl code uses the SSL_OP_ALL define and thus logically always
  disables the OpenSSL fix.
  
  In order to keep the secure work-around workding, the
  SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS bit must not be set and this change
  makes sure of this.

- win32-threaded-resolver: stop using a dummy socket
  
  Previously the code would create a dummy socket while resolving just to

  made with the common create-socket callback can be confusing to apps

  proxy, it would always re-use the Host: header of the first request. As

  the desired casing.

- libcurl docs: add the new FTP accept option + errors

- timeleft_accept: ack global timeout, moved to ftp.c
  
  First off the timeout for accepting a server connect back must of course
  respect a global timeout. Then the timeleft function is only used by ftp

- FTP: move FTP-specific struct field to ftpc_conn
  
  "wait_data_conn" was added to the connectionbits in commit c834213ad5 for
  handling active FTP connections but as it is purely FTP specific and now
  only ever accessed by ftp.c I moved it into the FTP connection struct.

- non-blocking active FTP: cleanup multi state usage
  
  Backpedaled out the funny double-change of state in the multi state
  machine by adding a new argument to the do_more() function to signal
  completion. This way it can remain in the DO_MORE state properly until
  done. Long term, the entire DO_MORE logic should be moved into the FTP
  code and be hidden from the multi code as the logic is only used for
  FTP.

- [Gokhan Sengun brought this change]

  FTP: perform active connections non-blocking
  
  1- Two new error codes are introduced.
  
  CURLE_FTP_ACCEPT_FAILED to be set whenever ACCEPTing fails because of
  FTP server connected.
  
  CURLE_FTP_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT to be set whenever ACCEPTing timeouts.
  
  Neither of these errors are considered fatal and control connection
  remains OK because it could just be a firewall blocking server to
  connect to the client.
  
  2- One new setopt option was introduced.
  
  CURLOPT_ACCEPTTIMEOUT_MS
  
  It sets the maximum amount of time FTP client is going to wait for a
  server to connect. Internal default accept timeout is 60 seconds.

- sockets: new Curl_socket_check() can wait for 3 sockets

  curl.h: add __ANDROID__ macro check

    /path/to/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc -E -dM - < /dev/null \

    #define __ANDROID__ 1
  
  We really need to check both ANDROID and __ANDROID__ since I've observed
  that:
  
  * if you use Android.mk file(s) and the 'ndk-build' script (aka vanilla
  way), ANDROID is predefined (see -DANDROID extra C flag),
  
  * if you use the Android Standalone Toolchain, then __ANDROID__ is

- lib500: verify timers relative each other
  
  As commit ce896875f8 fixed a timer that accidentally had been moved in
  code and then returned a bad timer, the lib500.c code (used in test 500
  and some others) now verifies 5 timers against each other to verify that
  they have the correct relative values. We cannot compare against
  absolute values as the timings will vary a lot.

- Curl_pgrsTime: store now in an auto variable
  
  It makes it easier to introduce debug outputs in this function, and
  everything in the function is using the value anyway so it might even be
  more efficient.

- timer: restore PRETRANSFER timing
  
  Regression introduced in 7.23.0 with commit 9dd85bce. The function in
  which the PRETRANSFER time stamp was recorded was moved in time causing
  it be stored very quickly after the start timestamp. On most systems
  shorter than 1 millisecond and thus it wouldn't even show with -w
  "%{time_pretransfer}" using the command line tool.

  configure: add symbols versioning option
  
  Allow, at configure time, the production of versioned symbols. The
  symbols will look like "CURL_<FLAVOUR>_<VERSION> <SYMBOL>", where
  <FLAVOUR> represents the SSL flavour (e.g. OPENSSL, GNUTLS, NSS, ...),
  <VERSION> is the major SONAME version and <SYMBOL> is the actual symbol
  name. If no SSL library is enabled the symbols will be just
  "CURL_<VERSION> <SYMBOL>".

  CURLOPT_INTERFACE: avoid resolving interfaces names
  
  Do not try to resolve interfaces names via DNS by recognizing interface
  names in a few ways.  If the interface option argument has a prefix of
  "if!" then treat the argument as only an interface.  Similarly, if the
  interface argument is the name of an interface (even if it does not have
  an IP address assigned), treat it as an interface name.  Finally, if the
  interface argument is prefixed by "host!" treat it as a hostname that
  must be resolved by /etc/hosts or DNS.
  
  These changes allow a client using the multi interfaces to avoid
  blocking on name resolution if the interface loses its IP address or
  disappears.

- FTP: close callback fix
  
  Keep track of which sockets that are the result of accept() calls and

- FTP: call opensocket callback properly
  
  When the new socket is created for an active connection, it is now done
  using the open socket callback.
  
  Test case 596 was modified to run fine, although it hides the fact that
  the close callback is still called too many times, as it also gets
  called for closing sockets that were created with accept().

  multi: handle timeouts on DNS servers by checking for new sockets
  
  If the first name server is not available, the multi interface does
  not invoke the socket_cb when the DNS request to the first name server
  timesout.  Ensure that the list of sockets are always updated after
  calling Curl_resolver_is_resolved.
  
  This bug can be reproduced if Curl is complied with --enable_ares and
  your code uses the multi socket interfaces and the
  CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION option.  To test try:
    iptables -I INPUT \
             -s $(sed -n -e '/name/{s/.* //p;q}' /etc/resolv.conf)/32 \
             -j REJECT
  and then run a program which uses the multi-interface.

- POP3: detect when LIST returns no mails
  
  By making sure the function can detect an "end of body" sequence
  immediately on the first line, test 811 is now enabled.

- ftpserver: output CRLF in logs
  
  Previously the log function would just filter out all CR and LF
  occurances from the log to make it more readable. This had the downside
  that it made it very hard to see CR LFs when they actually matters.
  
  Now, they're instead converted to "[CR]" and "[LR]" in the log to become
  apparent to readers.

- POP3: fix end of body detection
  
  Curl_pop3_write() now has a state machine that scans for the end of a
  POP3 body so that the CR LF '.' CR LF sequence can come in everything
  from one up to five subsequent packets.
  
  Test case 810 is modified to use SLOWDOWN which makes the server pause
  between each single byte and thus makes the POP3 body get sent to curl
  basically one byte at a time.

- test: added POP3 test with dot-prefixed line
  
  Test 815 is disabled for now since libcurl currently doesn't unescape

  for timeouts libcurl marks the control channel as "invalid". As this
  test case times out for the data connection it could still use the
  control channel.

  query-part: ignore the URI part for given protocols

  defines, and yet make the code clearly show what the macro is used for.

- test 590: verify the bug fix in 4851dafcf1

  HTTP auth: fix proxy Negotiate bug
  
  If a proxy offers several Authentication schemes where NTLM and
  Negotiate are offered by the proxy and you tell libcurl not to use the
  Negotiate scheme then the request never returns when the proxy answers
  with its HTTP 407 reply.
  
  It is reproducible by the following steps:
  
  - Use a proxy that offers NTLM and Negotiate ( CURLOPT_PROXY and
  CURLOPT_PROXYPORT )
  
  - Tell libcurl NOT to use Negotiate CURL_EASY_SETOPT(CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH,
  CURLAUTH_BASIC | CURLAUTH_DIGEST | CURLAUTH_NTLM )
  
  - Start the request
  
  The call to CURL_EASY_PERFORM never returns. If you switch on debug
  logging you can see that libcurl issues a new request As soon as it
  received the 407 reply. Instead it should return and set the response
  code to 407.

  curl_easy_cleanup(), curl_multi_cleanup and potentially each time a

  destruction of OpenSSL's thread local state hash.
  
  Multi-threaded apps using OpenSSL enabled libcurl should still call

- multi: start ftp state machine when switching to DO_MORE
  
  This extends the fix from commit d7934b8bd491
  
  When the multi state is changed within the multi_runsingle from DOING to
  DO_MORE, we didn't immediately start the FTP state machine again. That
  then left the FTP state in FTP_STOP. When curl_multi_fdset() was
  subsequently called, the ftp_domore_getsock() function would return the
  wrong fd info.

  I created test 587 in commit 840eff44f2b but forgot to add the file to
  the tarball. Added now.

- test 588: verify active FTP with multi interface without EPRT
  
  This is using the verbatim 525 test code but it disables EPRT in the
  server and this should work just as well anyway.

- FTP server: allow EPRT by default
  
  EPRT is now supported by default by the server. To disable it, use the
  generic REPLY instruction in the <servercmd> tag. Test 116 now has it
  disabled. All other existing active FTP port tests strip out the port
  commands from the logs already so the change of the server isn't that
  noticable.

- large headers: have curl accept >16K headers
  
  As commit 5850cc4808ab clarifies, libcurl can deliver header lines that
  are longer than CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE, only body data is limited to that
  size. The curl tool has check (when built debug-enabled) that made the
  wrong checks and this new test 1205 verifies that larger headers work.

- curl_multi_fdset: correct fdset with FTP PORT use
  
  After a PORT has been issued, and the multi handle would switch to the
  CURLM_STATE_DO_MORE state (which is unique for FTP), libcurl would
  return the wrong fdset to wait for when curl_multi_fdset() is
  called. The code would blindly assume that it was waiting for a connect
  of the second connection, while that isn't true immediately after the
  PORT command.
  
  Also, the function multi.c:domore_getsock() was highly FTP-centric and
  therefore ugly to keep in protocol-agnostic code. I solved this problem
  by introducing a new function pointer in the Curl_handler struct called
  domore_getsock() which is only called during the DOMORE state for
  protocols that set that pointer.
  
  The new ftp.c:ftp_domore_getsock() function now returns fdset info about
  the control connection's command/response handling while such a state is
  in use, and goes over to waiting for a writable second connection first
  once the commands are done.
  
  The original problem could be seen by running test 525 and checking the
  time stamps in the FTP server log. I can verify that this fix at least
  fixes this problem.

- sws.c: HTTP and GOPHER test server-side connection closing adjustment
  
  When, for a given test, server is instructed to close connection after
  server reply we now wait a very small amount of time (50ms) before doing

  reply before getting an ECONNRESET.
  
  The above is required to make test cases 1070, 1200, 1201 and 1202 pass
  with Cygwin 1.5.X on W2K.
  
  GOPHER test server closes connection after _every_ server-reply, as such,

  a server-side initiated disconnection.

  smtp: Added support for NTLM authentication
  
  Modified smtp_endofresp() to detect NTLM from the server specified list
  of supported authentication mechanisms.
  
  Modified smtp_authenticate() to start the sending of the NTLM data.
  
  Added smtp_auth_ntlm_type1_message() which creates a NTLM type-1
  message. This function is used by authenticate() to start the sending
  of data and by smtp_state_auth_ntlm_resp() when the AUTH command
  doesn't contain the type-1 message as part of the initial response.
  This lack of initial response can happen if an OOM error occurs or the
  type-1 message is longer than 504 characters. As the main AUTH command
  is limited to 512 character the data has to be transmitted in two
  parts; one containing the AUTH NTLM and the second containing the
  type-1 message.
  
  Added smtp_state_auth_ntlm_type2msg_resp() which handles the incoming
  type-2 message and sends an outgoing type-3 message. This type-2
  message is sent by the server in response to our type-1 message.
  
  Modified smtp_state_auth_resp() to handle the response to: the AUTH
  NTLM without the initial response and the type-2 response.
  
  Modified smtp_disconnect() to cleanup the NTLM SSPI stack.

  smtp: General tidy up ready for adding NTLM support
  
  Changed the name of variable l, in several functions, which represents

  Reworked smtp_authenticate() to be simpler and easier to follow.
  Variables and now initialised in their definitions and if no username
  and password are specified the function sets the state to SMTP_STOP and
  returns immediately, rather than being part of a huge if statement.

- POST: always set postfieldsize
  
  When we use binary posts and regular ones intermixed on a single command
  line, we cannot do strlen() etc on the data to figure out the length
  (when inserting '&' and more). We must therefore keep track of the post
  data length. Then we also end up setting the libcurl option with the
  known size, so that we don't risk that libcurl will do strlen() on the
  data.
  
  This has the minor side-effect that --libcurl source codes now always
  will use CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE but I don't consider that terribly
  damaging.
